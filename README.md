Spring MVC Application with pure Java config

## What I have done?

- Pure Java Configuration (Not any Spring related XML)
- Hibernate ORM using HibernateTemplate
- PostgreSQL as a RDBMS
- Ajax calls for updating the view
- Used Joda Time library to get the difference between 2 dates
- Added Procfile for Heroku purposes
- Deployed the app to the Heroku - https://todowary.herokuapp.com/
